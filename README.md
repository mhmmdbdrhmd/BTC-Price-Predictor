<h2>📦 Installation & Setup</h2>

<ol>
<li>Clone the repository:<pre><code>git clone &lt;repository-url&gt;</code></pre></li>
<li>Install required packages:<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre></li>
<li>Run the Flask app:<pre><code>flask run</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<h2>🛠 How It Works</h2>

<p>Starting with a simple command, the user initiates the Crypto Kline Data Downloader from their terminal. Utilizing the intuitive UI, they can effortlessly navigate to the search bar, where they input their desired cryptocurrency pair. The system then prompts the user to select their preferred time interval and date range for the data.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, our application employs Selenium to navigate and interact with web pages dynamically, ensuring the accurate retrieval of requested data. Concurrently, Requests handle direct HTTP requests to APIs for speed and efficiency. Once the data is fetched, it's processed and made available for download, with the user being notified of the completion status through real-time feedback mechanisms.</p>

<p>The result is a comprehensive dataset of kline information, ready for analysis or integration into trading strategies, delivered with unparalleled ease and speed.</p>
